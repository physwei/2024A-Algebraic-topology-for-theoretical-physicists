Animated visualization of the Hopf fibration S1->S3->S2

The necessary pacakges are numpy and matplotlib. (My version is numpy 1.25.0, matplotlib 3.7.1, python 3.11.4. Haven't check if lower versions also work.) To have different contours on the S2, modify ref_phi (on line 24), ref_theta (on line 37), and the associated color_map (on line 50). Run the python script on terminals will automatically create and store the animation.
